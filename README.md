## Entry Points for Contributors

**Start anywhere. Fork freely. No permission needed.**

### Story Entry Points

- Write a scene where a character discovers the forest network is communicating a specific, urgent warning about a nearby community.
- Draft a letter from Samuel to his deceased father, explaining why he is or isn't joining the protest.
- Create a monologue for Dr. Abena Gyamfi, giving a fiery lecture to Nexus executives about the difference between data and wisdom.
- Write a 'found document'—a Nexus internal memo that outlines the profit potential of the mycelial network, revealing their true intentions.

### Technical Entry Points

- Design a speculative interface for Kofi's sensor posts that visualizes the forest's chemical 'conversations' in real-time.
- Propose a decentralized, blockchain-adjacent system for storing and granting access to the ecological data, controlled by the local community rather than Nexus.
